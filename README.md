Section 7.1: Return to a previous commit
To jump back to a previous commit, first find the commit's hash using git log.
To temporarily jump back to that commit, detach your head with:
```git checkout 789abcd
This places you at commit 789abcd. You can now make new commits on top of this old commit without affecting the
branch your head is on. Any changes can be made into a proper branch using either branch or checkout -b.
To roll back to a previous commit while keeping the changes:
```git reset --soft 789abcd
To roll back the last commit:
```git reset --soft HEAD~
To permanently discard any changes made after a specific commit, use:
```git reset --hard 789abcd
To permanently discard any changes made after the last commit:
```git reset --hard HEAD~
Beware: While you can recover the discarded commits using reflog and reset, uncommitted changes cannot be
recovered. Use git stash; git reset instead of git reset --hard to be safe.
Section 7.2: Undoing changes
Undo changes to a file or directory in the working copy.
```git checkout -- file.txt
Used over all file paths, recursively from the current directory, it will undo all changes in the working copy.
```git checkout -- .
To only undo parts of the changes use --patch. You will be asked, for each change, if it should be undone or not.
```git checkout --patch -- dir
To undo changes added to the index.
```git reset --hard
Without the --hard flag this will do a soft reset.
With local commits that you have yet to push to a remote you can also do a soft reset. You can thus rework the files
